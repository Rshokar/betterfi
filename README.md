## <a id="project-description"></a>Project Description
During my second term at BCIT i participate in a hackathon centered on the theme of career stability, our team birthed the idea of Betterfi. Betterfi is an innovative tool designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and their dream roles. By simply inputting a job posting URL, users unlock a suite of functionalities. The core of Betterfi lies in its ability to parse essential skills from job postings and intelligently recommend a curated list of video courses and pertinent technical interview questions, tailored to enhance the user's candidacy for the role.

But the ingenuity of Betterfi doesn't stop there. In a groundbreaking move, it leverages the power of AI to generate customized cover letters, specifically tailored to individual job postings, elevating the application process to new heights of personalization and effectiveness.

Our team, a blend of diverse talents and perspectives, divided into two synergistic units. One focused on crafting a seamless and intuitive client-side experience, utilizing the robust capabilities of React. The other, which included my contributions, delved into the complexities of backend architecture. We embraced a stack composed of Node.js, Express, Firestore, coupled with the sophisticated AI capabilities of the ChatGPT API, and the expansive resources of the YouTube API.

This fusion of technologies and collaborative effort culminated in a solution not just theoretical but practical and impactful in enhancing career stability. Our dedication and innovation were recognized with a second-place finish, accompanied by a $1000 prize, a testament to the potential of Betterfi in revolutionizing the job application process.
